## A review, start to finish

It's late afternoon. You have three merge requests waiting on you, a pipeline that went red after lunch, and a terminal full of agents. Reviewing used to mean a browser tab per request, a `git checkout` that trampled whatever you were doing, and copy-pasting code into a chat to ask "is this right?".

With Redline you press **`Cmd+Shift+F`**.

### 1. See what's waiting

![The Redline panel: open requests on the left, the selected one's status on the right](docs/panel-overview.png)

Every open request for the repo you're in, in one list. Each one carries:

- a **pipeline dot** (passed, failed or running),
- **◆ 3**, the number of unresolved threads,
- a **you** badge when your review was asked for and you haven't approved yet.

Click **Waiting on me** to see only those. Click **My MRs** to see your own, each with what's blocking it ("Needs an approving review", "Has merge conflicts") or **Ready to merge**.

The **Overview** tab answers the question you open a request with: *can this merge, and if not, why?* It shows the blockers, how far behind the target the request is, and whether it's a draft. From there you can:

- **Merge**, with squash and delete-branch options, or merge when the pipeline succeeds,
- flip **draft ↔ ready**,
- add or remove **labels, assignees and reviewers**.

**Comments** shows every thread, so you can reply or resolve without leaving. **Commits** and **Description** are one click away.

### 2. Find out why the pipeline is red

![The Pipeline tab: stages, jobs, durations, logs, retry and Ask AI](docs/panel-pipeline.png)

The **Pipeline** tab lays the run out stage by stage, child pipelines included, with each job's status and duration.

- **Log** opens a job's log in a terminal tab.
- **Retry**, **Run** (for manual jobs) and **Cancel** do what they say. **Retry failed** re-runs everything that broke.
- **Ask AI** on a failed job sends the end of its log to your agent, asking it to find the cause in the branch. Nobody has to read 4,000 lines of CI output first.

### 3. Review it properly, with an agent beside you

Pick **Start review ▸**, and choose who sits next to the diff: Claude Code, Codex, any agent Herdr knows, a **Council review**, or just a shell.

Redline checks the branch out in **its own git worktree**, under `~/.herdr/worktrees`, so your working copy is never touched. It then opens a review tab: your agent on one side, the diff on the other. They're ordinary Herdr panes, so you can close, zoom or split them as usual.

![The review pane: a syntax-highlighted diff, the review bar, and a council finding ready to accept](docs/review-pane.png)

- **Select a line** (shift-click for a range) to:
  - **Ask AI** about exactly those lines,
  - post a **single comment**,
  - or **start a review**, collecting pending comments and posting them together.
- **Reply** to and **resolve** existing threads right on the line, and **edit** your pending comments before they go out.
- **Submit review** posts everything at once, as a comment or an approval. GitHub also offers *request changes*.
- **Full file** shows the whole file around the changes. The diff is **syntax-highlighted**.
- If the author pushes while you're reviewing, an **Update** button appears. Comments are never anchored to stale lines.

### 4. Let the council weigh in

Choose **Council review** and the agent starts a multi-model review of the branch. Its confirmed findings land in the pane as **✦** markers and a findings list:

- **Accept** turns a finding into a pending comment as written.
- **Open** jumps to the line with the text ready to edit.
- **Drop** dismisses it.

The AI drafts; you decide what's posted under your name. Nothing reaches GitLab or GitHub until you submit.

### 5. Ship it, then clean up

Approve, or submit with **Approve**. When you're done, **Finish** removes the review's worktree and closes the tab. It checks first, and warns you about uncommitted or unpushed work before throwing anything away.

## Why it helps

| Before | With Redline |
|---|---|
| A browser tab per request, context lost on every switch | One panel per repo, everything in your terminal workspace |
| `git checkout` over your work-in-progress | A separate worktree per review, removed when you finish |
| Copy-pasting code into a chat to ask about it | Select lines, **Ask AI**: the agent gets the file, the lines and your question |
| Reading CI logs top to bottom | **Ask AI** on the failed job |
| AI review comments you can't control | Council findings arrive as drafts you accept, edit or drop |
| "Why can't this merge?" | The blockers, listed in plain words, with Merge right below |

## Features

- **Requests panel** (`Cmd+Shift+F` / `Ctrl+Shift+F`):
  - open MRs/PRs plus branches without a request;
  - filtering, **Waiting on me** and **My MRs**;
  - pipeline status, unresolved-thread count and review-requested badge.
- **Overview tab:**
  - merge blockers and commits behind the target;
  - Merge (squash, delete branch, when the pipeline succeeds) and cancel auto-merge;
  - draft ↔ ready;
  - labels, assignees, reviewers.
- **Comments:** threaded discussions with reply and resolve, plus general comments.
- **Commits** and **Description** tabs.
- **Pipeline tab:**
  - stages and jobs, including GitLab child pipelines and GitHub check runs;
  - logs, retry, run, cancel, retry failed;
  - Ask AI on failures; auto-refresh while running.
- **Review tabs:**
  - a git worktree per review and your choice of agent;
  - a diff with syntax highlighting, rename detection and a full-file view.
- **Line comments:**
  - single comments, or pending reviews (GitLab draft notes; GitHub reviews);
  - submit as comment, approve or request changes;
  - reply, resolve, edit pending.
- **Ask AI** from any line selection.
- **Council review:** findings as ✦ markers you accept, edit or drop.
- **Update** when the request moves; **Finish** to remove the worktree.
- Works with **GitLab** (including self-hosted) and **GitHub**, through `glab` and `gh`.

## Install

You need the [Herdr app](https://herdr.dev), `git`, and `glab` and/or `gh` logged in (`glab auth login`, `gh auth login`). For the Council review option you need Claude Code with the `council` skill.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iampedii/herdr-redline.git
cp -R herdr-redline/mods/redline ~/.config/herdr-app/mods/
herdr-app check ~/.config/herdr-app/mods/redline
```

Then add the keys from [`keys.json`](keys.json) to the `"global"` section of `~/.config/herdr-app/keys.json`:

```json
"cmd-shift-f": "mod.open:redline",
"ctrl-shift-f": "mod.open:redline"
```

Herdr picks the mod up within a second. Focus a terminal inside a git repository and press `Cmd+Shift+F`.

## How it works

Redline is a Herdr mod written in gpui-kit JavaScript.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `launcher.js` | The requests panel. |
| `panels.js` | The Overview and Pipeline tabs. |
| `diff.js` | The review pane. |
| `hosting.js` | Every GitLab and GitHub call, through `glab api` / `gh`. |
| `lib.js` | git, the worktree checkout and diff parsing. |
| `highlight.js` | The line highlighter. |

Pending GitLab comments are real draft notes on the server, so they also show as pending on the website. GitHub's are kept locally until you submit, then sent as one review.

## Status and limits

Redline is young. Things to know:

- **Test writes on a request that doesn't matter first.** The read paths are tested against GitLab and GitHub. Merge, the draft toggle, label, assignee and reviewer edits, and job retry/cancel are built on the documented APIs but haven't been run against a real request yet.
- On GitLab, a comment on a **range** of lines is posted on its last line. GitHub keeps the range.
- **Notifications** (review requested, pipeline failed, replies) are written but switched off. They need a home in the Herdr window that can't block clicks.
- The requests list shows up to 50 open requests.

Issues and pull requests are welcome.
